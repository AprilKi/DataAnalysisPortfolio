# April Ki - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About Me
Hello. My name is April Ki and I recently completed a Data Analytics program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). 
My sufficient skills are to create dashboards using Excel, Power BI and Tableau for data visualization and also handle mining and cleaning data with professional knowledge of MS SQL and Python. Using data to perform diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis presents the best results after carefully analyzing the project's purpose and scanning the data deeply.

## Projects

### Sales of Book 
<li><strong>MS SQL Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/DataAnalysisPortfolio/blob/main/DataExplorationSQL">
<code>DataExploration_SQL</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The data for sales of books across the region of Canada was including of orders, products, customers, etc. The sales status of books is extracted from various viewpoints via years, customers, regions, prices, etc. to conduct a more in-depth analysis of sales.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Data exploration, complex statistical analysis, joins, aggregation functionss, create functions using MS SQL Server 2019, SSMS, DDL, DML, DQL, TCL, DCL, T-SQL</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> For sales, extracted Total sales yearly via product group and Total number or amount of products with the status of sales and analysis sales history or calculate the probability for percentage gender of customers using the aggregate functions. Moreover, predicted a percentage of customers using a binary classification model for zipcode and visa payment type.</li>


### BusinessLicences 2013
<li><strong>MS SQL Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/DataAnalysisPortfolio/blob/main/DataCleaningSQL.sql">
<code>DataCleaning_SQL</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> Running of business in Vancouver was issued a unique RSN automatically via the system including business name, address, issued dates, etc via year. The purpose of this project is to improve data quality via inspecting and cleaning the data.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Data cleaning, Data quality using MS SQL Server 2019, SSMS, DQL, DML, T-SQL</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> Converted invalid format of postal code, replaced invalid city name and divided sting values of issued-date or extract-date.</li>


### Maketing Campaigns of the Bank 
<li><strong>Python Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb"><code>MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong>The data contained customers of the bank information with age, job, marital, education, balance, etc. and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not. The goal of this project is to predict the classification of the client who will subscribe to a term deposit in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Data cleaning, data analysis, python coding, data visualization, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> Understood input variables that how the marketing has impacted the customers who subscribe to the service and the length of contact with customers and previous subscription experience. I completed the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, data modelling, and hypothesis testing. Consequently, compared and analyzed multiple data models to derive the best model via identifying significant features. </li>


### Billionaires 2022
<li><strong>Tableau Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.ki4896/viz/BILLIONAIRES2022/FobesBillionaires2022"><code>FobesBillionaires2022</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The goal is to design the 2022 Billionaires in an easy-to-understand way using a Tableau visualization dashboard with a summary of countries and featuring the top 10 billionaires.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Identify the audience for conception, tableau functions, design an analytical dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> It consists of a dashboard that a summary of 2022 billionaires, the number of people, average age, total amount, gender, self-made, etc. by country on the map, a ranking of the top 10 billionaires and individual information.</li>


### Student Performance of Test
<li><strong>Tableau Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.ki4896/viz/StudentPerfomance_16594734536610/Student"><code>StudentPerformance</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong>The scores for three subjects, reading, writing, and math, of 1000 students analyzed the results of achievement were shown. By using the dashboard, organize the test results of all students in an easy-to-understand manner. Also, filtering of the average score for each subject and the grade for each condition is provided so that the details could be viewed.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Identify the audience for conception, tableau functions, design an analytical dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> The three major implementations were made to create the distribution of scores for each subject through a graph, and determine the median score by gender. The median scores of the students who passed the subject were analyzed by gender, test preparation, race/ethnic group, and parental education level. In addition, the grade distribution for each subject was investigated. By implementing a filter function, you can see detailed information.</li>


### AdventureWorks 2016 
<li><strong>PowerBI Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/DataAnalysisPortfolio/blob/main/AdventureWorksPowerBI.pdf">
<code>AdventureWorks2016</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The 2016 revenue of sales is across six countries (Canada, United States, France, etc) in three categories clothing, bikes and accessories. The goal of the KPI dashboard displays Revenue growth via categories, profit margin or client retention rate.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Power BI, DAX, power query, power map, power pivot, power view</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> Created power query, graphs and pivot tables using Dax such as aggregate, counting, logical or text functions. Analyzed product details and obtained total revenue or month of the month for each country. The Moving Annual Total (MAT) of profits for specific products shows graphs of the total value over the last 12 months. Additionally, the executive summary and customer demographic were printed.</li>
