# April Ki - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About Me
Hello. I'm April Ki and I recently completed a Data Analytics program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). 
My sufficient skills are to create dashboards using Excel, Power BI and Tableau for data visualization and also handle mining and cleaning data with professional knowledge of SQL, Python and R. Using data to perform diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis presents the best results after carefully analyzing the project's purpose and scanning the data deeply.


## Projects

### Sales of Book 
<li><strong>MS SQL Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/DataAnalysisPortfolio/blob/main/DataExplorationSQL">
<code>DataExploration_SQL</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The data for sales of books across the region of Canada was including of orders, products, customers, etc. The sales status of books is extracted from various viewpoints via years, customers, regions, prices, etc. to conduct a more in-depth analysis of sales.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Data exploration, complex statistical analysis, joins, aggregation functionss, create functions using MS SQL Server 2019, SSMS, DDL, DML, DQL, TCL, DCL, T-SQL</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> For sales, extracted Total sales yearly via product group and Total number or amount of products with the status of sales and analysis sales history or calculate the probability for percentage gender of customers using the aggregate functions. Moreover, predicted a percentage of customers using a binary classification model for zipcode and visa payment type.</li>


### BusinessLicences 2013
<li><strong>MS SQL Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/DataAnalysisPortfolio/blob/main/DataCleaningSQL.sql">
<code>DataCleaning_SQL</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> Running of business in Vancouver was issued a unique RSN automatically via the system including business name, address, issued dates, etc via year. The purpose of this project is to improve data quality via inspecting and cleaning the data.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Data cleaning, Covert invaild format values using MS SQL Server 2019, SSMS, DQL, DML, T-SQL</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> Converted invalid format of postal code, replaced invalid city name and divided issued-date or extract-date.</li>


### Maketing Campaigns of the Bank 
<li><strong>Python Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb"><code>MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong>The data contains customers of the bank information with age, job, marital, education, balance and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not. Understanding of input variables predicts how the marketing has impacted the customers who subscribe to the service and the length of contact with customers and previous subscription experience. </li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, data modelling, and hypothesis testing. Data cleaning, data analysis, python coding, data visualization, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics with Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> Compared and analyzed multiple data models to derive the best model via identifying significant features.</li>


### Billionaires 2022
<li><strong>Tableau Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.ki4896/viz/BILLIONAIRES2022/FobesBillionaires2022"><code>FobesBillionaires2022</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The goal is to show the 2022 Billionaires in an easy-to-understand way using the Tableau dashboard. 
  It consists of a dashboard: a summary of 2022 billionaires, the number of people, average age, total amount, gender, self-made, etc. by country on the map, a ranking of the top 10 billionaires and individual information.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Identify the audience for conception, tableau functions, design an analytical dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> created a visualization dashboard with a summary of countries and featured the top 10 billionaires.</li>


### Student Performance of Test
<li><strong>Tableau Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.ki4896/viz/StudentPerfomance_16594734536610/Student"><code>StudentPerformance</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong>The scores for each subject of 1000 students were analyzed, reading, writing, math, and the results of achievement were shown. For this purpose, three major implementations were made. Create the distribution of scores for each subject through a graph, and determine the median score by gender. The median scores of the students who passed the subject were analyzed by gender, test preparation, race/ethnic group, and parental education level. In addition, the grade distribution for each subject was investigated. By implementing a filter function, you can see detailed information.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Identify the audience for conception, tableau functions, design an analytical dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> By using the dashboard, organize the test results of all students in an easy-to-understand manner. The average score for each subject and the grade for each condition were filtered so that the details could be viewed.</li>


### AdventureWorks 2016 
<li><strong>PowerBI Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/DataAnalysisPortfolio/blob/main/AdventureWorksPowerBI.pdf">
<code>AdventureWorks2016</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The 2016 revenue of sales is across six countries (Canada, United States, France, etc) in three categories clothing, bikes and accessories. The goal of the KPI dashboard displays Revenue growth via categories, profit margin or client retention rate.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Power BI, DAX, power query, power map, power pivot, power view</li>
<li><strong>Result: </strong> </li>
