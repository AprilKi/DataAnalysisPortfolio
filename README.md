# April Ki - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About Me
Hello. I'm April Ki and I recently completed a Data Analytics program at BCIT(British Columbia Institute of Technology). I have considerable Excel, Power BI and Tableau skills for dashboards data visualization. Also, I'm available to handle mining and cleaning data with sufficient knowledge of SQL, Python and R. Use data to perform diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis for best results after carefully analyzing the project's purpose and scanning the data deeply.

## Projects

### Sales of Book
<li><strong>MS SQL Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb"><code>MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong>The data contains customers of the bank information with age, job, marital, education, balance and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not. Understanding of input variables predicts how the marketing has impacted the customers who subscribe to the service and the length of contact with customers and previous subscription experience. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, data modelling, and hypothesis testing.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Data cleaning, data analysis, python coding, data visualization, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics.</li>
<li><strong>Technology: </strong> Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn
<li><strong>Result: </strong> Compared and analyzed multiple data models to derive the best model via identifying significant features.</li>

### Maketing Campaigns of the Bank 
<li><strong>Python Code: </strong><a href="https://github.com/AprilKi/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb"><code>MarketingCampaignsBank.ipynb</code></a></li>

### Billionaires 2022
<li><strong>Tableau Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.ki4896/viz/BILLIONAIRES2022/FobesBillionaires2022"><code>FobesBillionaires2022</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong> The goal is to show the 2022 Billionaires in an easy-to-understand way using the Tableau dashboard. 
  It consists of a dashboard: a summary of 2022 billionaires, the number of people, average age, total amount, gender, self-made, etc. by country on the map, a ranking of the top 10 billionaires and individual information.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Identify the audience for conception, data preparation, and design of an analytical dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Technology: </strong> Tableau.
<li><strong>Result: </strong> created a visualization dashboard with a summary of countries and featured the top 10 billionaires.</li>

### Student Performance 
<li><strong>Tableau Dashboard: </strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jihyun.ki4896/viz/StudentPerfomance_16594734536610/Student"><code>StudentPerformance</code></a></li>
<li><strong>Goal: </strong>The scores for each subject of 1000 students were analyzed, reading, writing, math, and the results of achievement were shown. For this purpose, three major implementations were made. Create the distribution of scores for each subject through a graph, and determine the median score by gender. The median scores of the students who passed the subject were analyzed by gender, test preparation, race/ethnic group, and parental education level. In addition, the grade distribution for each subject was investigated. By implementing a filter function, you can see detailed information.</li>
<li><strong>Skills: </strong> Identify the audience for conception, data preparation, and design of an analytical dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Technology: </strong> Tableau.
<li><strong>Result: </strong> By using the dashboard, organize the test results of all students in an easy-to-understand manner. The average score for each subject and the grade for each condition were filtered so that the details could be viewed.</li>

## Skilled
<li><strong>MS SQL and Data Modelling: </strong> Data Mining and Cleaning, Enhanced entity-relationship modeling using UML, Use SQL - DDL to implement a relational database. 
<li><strong>MS SQL Visual Studio: </strong> Designing multidimensional Business Intelligence Semantic Model (BISM), Accessing different data sources, Creating multidimensional databases, Data mining.
<li><strong>Python: </strong> Data Collection, Predictive Modelling, Data Visualization - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn.
<li><strong>Excel: </strong> Filter and Sort Data, Conditional Formatting, Dashboard Reports with Pivot table. 
<li><strong>Tableau: </strong> Create Insightful and Interactive Visual Dashboards, Explore Tableauâ€™s statistical functions and forecasting capabilities.
<li><strong>MS Power BI: </strong> Explore different data connections to multiple sources, local, and online, Create filters and slicers for interactive visualizations, Tell the data story to engage stakeholders to bring insights from data visualizations.
<li><strong>Web Scraping with Python: </strong>  Create code and extract the data in the required format - Requests, Slenium, Selector Gadget, Beautiful Soup
